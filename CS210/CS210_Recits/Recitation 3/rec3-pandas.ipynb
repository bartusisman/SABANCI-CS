Missing Data is a very big problem in real life scenario. Missing Data can also refer to as NA(Not Available) values in pandas. In DataFrame sometimes many datasets simply arrive with missing data, either because it exists and was not collected or it never existed. For Example, Suppose different user being surveyed may choose not to share their income, some user may choose not to share the address in this way many datasets went missing.\n","\n","Pandas primarily uses the value np.nan to represent missing data. It is by default not included in any computation.\n","\n","First, let's check where nan values are located in our dataset."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-02-25T10:14:03.382859Z","start_time":"2019-02-25T10:14:03.358818Z"},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":455},"colab_type":"code","executionInfo":{"elapsed":1090,"status":"ok","timestamp":1581862398971,"user":{"displayName":"Hasan Alp Boz","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBD7c6QsVXDqCL3U9BD95Io8BJanIgHMafOyT-qTw=s64","userId":"11954634311834405503"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"fPL7lqPTY9sO","outputId":"68e58e55-70e0-49f3-9abd-c271361b45f7"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Team</th>\n","      <th>Number</th>\n","      <th>Position</th>\n","      <th>Age</th>\n","      <th>Height</th>\n","      <th>Weight</th>\n","      <th>College</th>\n","      <th>Salary</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Name</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Aaron Brooks</th>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Aaron Gordon</th>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Aaron Harrison</th>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Adreian Payne</th>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Al Horford</th>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Wilson Chandler</th>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Xavier Munford</th>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>True</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Zach LaVine</th>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Zach Randolph</th>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Zaza Pachulia</th>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","      <td>True</td>\n","      <td>False</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","<p>457 rows × 8 columns</p>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                  Team  Number  Position  ...
