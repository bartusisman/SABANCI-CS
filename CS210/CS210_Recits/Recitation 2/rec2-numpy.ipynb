`flatten` have the same effect on arrays. The difference between is the new array created using ravel is actually a reference to the parent array. So, any changes to the new array will affect the parent as well. But is memory efficient since it does not create a copy."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"e6P9N9VlB_vQ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Random\n","\n","The `random` module provides nice functions to generate random numbers (and also statistical distributions) of any given shape.\n","\n","``` py\n","# random numbers between [0,1) of shape 2,2\n",">>> np.random.rand(2,2)\n","[[0.60332224 0.37830503]\n"," [0.1736118  0.38234196]]\n"," \n","# standard normal distribution with mean=0 and variance=1 of shape 2,2\n",">>> np.random.randn(2,2)\n","[[-2.10285019  0.4114038 ]\n"," [-0.65259364 -0.05859651]]\n","\n","# random integers between [0, 10) of shape 2,2\n",">>> np.random.randint(0, 10, size=[2,2])\n","[[8 9]\n"," [9 9]]\n","\n","# one random number between [0,1)\n",">>> np.random.random()\n","0.8150009405258001\n","\n","# random numbers between [0,1) of shape 2,2\n",">>> np.random.random(size=[2,2])\n","[[0.64642465 0.22353422]\n"," [0.97918432 0.44304317]]\n","\n","# rick 10 items from a given list, with equal probability\n",">>> np.random.choice(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'], size=10)\n","['o' 'e' 'i' 'a' 'i' 'a' 'e' 'u' 'e' 'i']\n","\n","# pick 10 items from a given list with a predefined probabilities\n",">> np.random.choice(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'], \n","    size=10, p=[0.3, .1, 0.1, 0.4, 0.1])\n","['o' 'o' 'o' 'o' 'o' 'i' 'o' 'e' 'e' 'u']\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"w0MAdxzevYC9","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Exercise 1\n","\n","- Create a `5x5` matrix that contains `random integers between 0-50`.\n","- Normalize the matrix so that `all rows sum to 1.0.`\n","- Finally, show that the summation of all rows add up to 1."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ZNFCiBN79S9c","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# your code"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MtNgED2D78Tq","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Exercise 2\n","\n","- Create a function named `euclidean_dist`, which takes two parameters as numpy arrays and returns the euclidean distance between them.\n"," \n","**Euclidean Distance**\n","\n","$\\sqrt{\\sum_i^N \\, (v_i - u_i)^2}$"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"YH4QUEQ4-lO2","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# your code"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
