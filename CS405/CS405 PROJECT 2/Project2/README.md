# CS 405 Project 2

### Task 1: Non-Power-of-Two Texture Support
- Modified the setTexture method to handle textures of any size
- Implemented proper texture parameter handling for non-power-of-2 textures
- Used CLAMP_TO_EDGE and LINEAR filtering for non-power-of-2 textures

### Task 2: Lighting Implementation
- Implemented Phong lighting model in the fragment shader
- Added support for ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting
- Implemented light position controls and lighting parameter adjustments

### Task 3: Normal Vector Visualization
- Added support for visualizing normal vectors
- Implemented proper normal vector calculations and display

### Task 4 (Optional): Multiple Texture Support
- Added support for multiple textures per object
- Implemented texture blending with configurable blend factor
- Added support for normal mapping


### Notes
- I couldnt implemented the UI interface for the task 4, since i needed to modify the project2.html file and it is not allowed in the instructions but the .js functions are implemented.
