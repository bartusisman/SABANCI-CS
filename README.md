# SABANCI-CS

These are almost all Sabanci CS courses I took and their corresponding projects.

## CS204: Object Oriented Programming

Basic C++ projects that mainly focus on the object-oriented features of C++, maximizing the utilities of LinkedLists, pointers, dynamic linking, and implementing some complex algorithms.

## CS210: Introduction to Data Science

### Project Overview
This course involved projects that applied data science techniques to analyze and predict economic and market trends. The primary focus was on exploring relationships between various economic indicators and stock market prices using machine learning models.

### Projects

#### 1. Stock Market vs. Mental Health (2019-2021)
- **Objective**: To analyze the relationship between crude oil prices and public mental health.
- **Summary**: This project examined how fluctuations in crude oil prices impacted mental health metrics. Data visualization techniques such as histograms and scatter plots were used to highlight trends and correlations between these variables.
- **Key Findings**: 
  - Stability in oil prices generally corresponded with economic predictability, while broader mental health metrics indicated more variability and external influences.
  - The scatter plot of crude oil prices versus mentally unhealthy days suggested complex interactions not solely explained by oil prices.

#### 2. Natural Gas Prices and S&P 500 Prediction
- **Objective**: To predict changes in the S&P 500 index based on natural gas prices and GDP growth rates.
- **Summary**: This project employed machine learning models to predict S&P 500 price changes using natural gas price changes and GDP growth as predictors.
  - **Models Used**: Random Forest Regressor and Support Vector Regressor (SVR).
  - **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and merged datasets from stock market data (2019-2024) and world GDP growth data (1980-2024), focusing on relevant years and metrics.
  - **Key Findings**: 
    - The Random Forest Regressor performed slightly better than the SVR but neither model showed high accuracy (both had negative RÂ² values).
    - The analysis indicated that natural gas prices alone are not strong predictors of S&P 500 prices, suggesting the influence of other economic factors.
- **Code Highlights**:
  ```python
  # Example from main.py
  # Train a linear regression model to predict S&P 500 prices based on natural gas prices
  from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
  
  model = LinearRegression()
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)
  y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
  
  print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)}")
  ```

  ```python
  # Example from ML_Models.py
  # Train and evaluate Random Forest and SVR models
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
  from sklearn.svm import SVR
  
  rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
  rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
  rf_predictions = rf.predict(X_test)
  
  svr = SVR(kernel='linear')
  svr.fit(X_train, y_train)
  svr_predictions = svr.predict(X_test)
  
  print(f"Random Forest Regressor MSE: {mean_squared_error(y_test, rf_predictions)}")
  print(f"Support Vector Regressor MSE: {mean_squared_error(y_test, svr_predictions)}")
  ```

### Projects

#### 1. PA1: Pipe Simulation
- **Objective**: To simulate the behavior of pipes in Unix-like operating systems using C.
- **Summary**: 
  - The project involved creating a parent (SHELL) process that forks two child processes (MAN and GREP). The first child executes the `man` command and the second child executes the `grep` command, simulating a pipeline between them.

  - Command execution using `execvp()`.
  - File operations for output redirection using `open()`.

  ```c
  // Example from PA1
  int fd[2]; // fd[0] for read, fd[1] for write
  pipe(fd);
  int child1 = fork();

  if (child1 == 0) { // MAN process
      close(fd[0]);
      dup2(fd[1], STDOUT_FILENO);
      char *man_parts[4] = {"man", "grep", "ls", NULL};
      execvp("man", man_parts);
  } else {
      int child2 = fork();
      if (child2 == 0) { // GREP process
          wait(NULL);
          close(fd[1]);
          dup2(fd[0], STDIN_FILENO);
          close(STDOUT_FILENO);
          open("output.txt", O_CREAT | O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC, 0777);
          char *grep_parts[5] = {"grep", "-A2", "-e", "-n, --line-number", NULL};

   - **Channel Subscription**: Users can subscribe to two fixed channels, "IF100" and "SPS101". Subscription status is managed through buttons on the GUI.
   - **Message Sending and Receiving**: Users can send messages to subscribed channels and receive messages in real-time from other users.
   - **Client Actions**: The client interface logs all actions and server responses, providing feedback to the user.

2. **Server Module**:
   - **User Interface**: The server application provides a GUI to monitor connected clients, channel subscriptions, and server actions.
   - **Connection Management**: The server listens for incoming client connections on a specified port, managing multiple clients simultaneously.
   - **Client Authentication**: The server ensures that usernames are unique and manages client connections and disconnections.
   - **Message Broadcasting**: The server broadcasts messages to all subscribers of a channel. It handles subscribe and unsubscribe requests and updates the GUI accordingly.

### Summary
The CS408 project DiSUcord offered a hands-on experience in building a client-server messaging application using C# and Windows Forms. It involved critical aspects of computer networks, such as TCP socket programming, real-time communication, and managing multiple client connections. The project emphasized both the theoretical and practical understanding of network protocols and client-server architecture, reinforcing the concepts learned throughout the course.
